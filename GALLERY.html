            <p>This photo is taken last year when i go out with my friend . We eat at MyeongDong Topokki and this restaurant serves korean food . We ordered our favorite menu at this restaurant which is the Rabokki and Dol Sot Bibimbap . Rabokki is typically Ramyun and Topokki in one bowl . While bibimbap  is a bowl of rice layered with mixed vegetables, meat and egg. You have to mix everything up (including the red gochujang paste) before start eating. </p>
