            <p>This is the photo of my family . My mother is very kind and loving person . Plus , she is full of patience in handling all three of us . She is also very supportive and always give us advice . She always teach me how to cook and that is one of the reasons why i have the interest in cooking and learning new recipe .
                I have one brother , his name is Safwan Hadi . He is already married and he is 25 years old this year . My elder sister name is Ainin Sofiya and she is 22 years old . She study at KUIS in Bangi . She also love to cook and she often cook for me whenever she have the time . 
                Next , is my younger sister . Her name is Afaf Solehah . She is 19 years old . She love to bake and she have interest in pastries . She always bake some cake , puff , doughnut , tart and many more . My family also enjoy the dessert . I am more close with my mother's family than my late father's family . This is because we often do activity together and we will always spend time with each other a lot . My mom have 4 siblings including her . She is the eldest .
                I rarely meet my other family on my father's side because they live far from each other . During our free time , my family and i always spend time and go for a short vacation together . Sometimes , we will gather and eat together in the weekend . 
                We also like to celebrate birthday together and do some family bonding at that time . I am very close with my family and my aunties and uncles is very fun to be with . Besides , i am also very close with all of my cousins . One of the best moment is when we celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri or 
                birthday together . My late father died when i was 14 years old . My father is a very loving and supportive father . He always support me in anything that i do and my interest . He always teach me and explain about things that i do not know . I love to draw since i was young , and my father is my biggest fan .
                He always like to see my drawings . Moreover , my father always teach me english words and make me do some exercise . That is why i love english subject very much . And i can understand most of the words and phrase easily . Thanks to my wonderful father <3 . Alfatihah .
